# Codex Vitae

## Instructions

**If you are Cate:**

1. As often as you can: re-read your [Type 3 beliefs](#type-3-opinions) (opinions).
2. At the beginning of every month, read the whole thing and make any necessary edits.
3. At the beginning of every year archive the document.
4. Around the end of June every year, write a new yearly report.

**If you aren't Cate:**

1. Read this with the understanding that you are different than me — the way I live my life is not the way you should live yours.
2. Read the [Glossary](#glossary) for a general intro to my favorite ideas, starting with [What is this?](#what-is-this), then come back and read through the [Beliefs](#beliefs) that seem interesting to you. 
3. Check the [Changelog](https://github.com/catebest/public/commits/master/Codex.md) for updates since you last visited.
4. Consider creating your own Codex ([here's a template](https://www.penflip.com/terrie/codex-vitae-template))

## Beliefs

### Type 1: Metabeliefs
Beliefs about beliefs.

- This document's purpose is to capture my beliefs about the world as I know it. 
- This document's benefits grow over time, as beliefs change over time, and build on one another.
- It's always incomplete and out of date. 
- Some of these beliefs will be proven wrong. Some won't be proven wrong but will be wrong anyway.
- I’m open to changing my mind at any time about any belief by evidence, persuasion, whimsy, or chance. 
- I believe there may be benefit in categorizing beliefs into four types: beliefs about beliefs (metabeliefs, i.e. this one), beliefs about perceptions (how reality seems to be), beliefs about the meaning of reality (opinions about how myself and others might be best served to approach life), and beliefs about the future (predictions about how things will be in the future).

### Type 2: Perceptions
How reality seems to be. 2A is about how my mind and senses seem to work, 2B is about my take on spirituality, and 2C is about how I think the external world can be best explained based on the information I have.

#### 2A Perceptions: Senses
Personal mental and physical abilities, constraints, and biases.

- TODO: Complete this section

#### 2B Perceptions: Supersenses
My take on the spiritual and supernatural.

- TODO: Complete this section

#### 2C Perceptions: Explanatory
Science, politics, and the universe.

- TODO: Complete this section

### Type 3: Opinions
Beliefs about how I interpret my perceptions and synthesize the meaning of reality. 3A is about what this means for my own approach to life, and 3B is about how I believe society would best be structured.

#### 3A: Opinions: For Self
How I believe I want to approach life. These are all opt-in and apply only to myself.

- TODO: Complete this section

#### 3B: Opinions: For Society
How I believe society would best be structured.

- TODO: Complete this section

### Type 4: Predictions
How I think things will be in the future, based on the approximate year I think they’ll come true.

#### 4: Predictions: By 2018
- TODO: Complete this section

#### 4. Predictions: By 2025

## Glossary
 
### What is this?
This document was started in [December of 2016](https://github.com/catebest/public/blob/cb1481ae0d2458474d61d79cde6d9bef05a55a8c/Codex.md) as a result of a marketing email message I received from [Coach.me](https://coach.me) about writing one's own Codex vitae (see below). 

### Codex vitae
(NB: This definition has been preserved from the version of [Buster Benson's Codex vitae](https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/Codex.md) from which I forked this version.)
This is an idea coined by Robin Sloan in his book [Mr Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore](http://www.amazon.com/Mr-Penumbras-24-Hour-Bookstore-Novel/dp/1250037751). The idea is to write a book, the Codex Vitae or Book of Life, that represents everything I have learned in my life. If I lost all of my memories somehow, this could be something that helped me remember who I am. 

A post from Buster Benson about this topic: [Codex Vitae](http://wayoftheduck.com/codex-vitae). 

### Quality time
(NB: This definition has been preserved from the version of [Buster Benson's Codex vitae](https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/Codex.md) from which I forked this version.)
- TODO: Update this section, or replace it with a new section, depending on how much of it I wish to incorporate it into my own Codex Vitae
My own Codex Vitae's first chapter could possibly be about quality time and its role as the primary ends (and means) for a life well lived. There are 3 kinds of quality time that I want to seek out. The first is quality time with myself. Find my favorite ideas, core interests, and people that I can connect deeply with. The second is quality time with those favorite ideas and core interests, and the third is quality time with those people I can connect deeply with. They each feed into each other: I can't really connect deeply with others until I know myself sufficiently well; often times interests are strengthened by having people I can connect with and share with. It seems pretty ungameable to me. Seek quality time with myself, my interests, and others and I won't regret anything on my death bed.
