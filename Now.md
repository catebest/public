# What Cate is doing now

*Last updated: 28 DEC 2016.*

This page is accessible from [my public GitHub repo](https://github.com/catebest/public/blob/master/Now.md), and was inspired second-hand by [this post by Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff).

Here's what I'm doing now:

* Living in Arlington, VA.
* Working on a very active job search; being thankful for Unemployment Compensation.
* Continuing to write in some form each day after having recently established the habit.
* Seeking and maintaining enduring interpersonal connections.
